-shooting
-box2d physics
-gun upgrades, bullets, skills, etc
-possibly a 2.5d scroller 
-randomly generate maps
-enemies of varying difficulty..(obviously)

-in GunLocker ideally i'd like the vector's to contain actual GunComponents, not pointers, as i feel like the pointer method
could really get messy.


-Gun/ is working. :) it will generate guns and display the weapon, and some stats to the screen.


-KeyBindings will work similar to the sfml threading

-FileParser for GunLocker needs to be completed.
